## Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to run a chi-squared test using
your own dataset. This test is used when your variables are
**categorical**—also known as **nominal scale data**.

You will:

-   Learn about the types of chi-squared tests

-   Upload your data

-   Check assumptions

-   Run the test

-   Interpret the output

-   Report your findings

## Theory: What is a Chi-Squared Test?

Chi-squared tests are used to assess whether observed categorical data
differ significantly from what we would expect under a specific
hypothesis.

### There are two main types:

1.  **Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test** – Compares the distribution of a
    [single]{.underline} categorical variable to a theoretical
    distribution.
2.  **Chi-Square Test of Independence** – Assesses whether
    [two]{.underline} categorical variables are related.

> Example: Do people select card suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades)
> at random? If yes, we'd expect each suit to be selected 25% of the
> time.

The test statistic is calculated as:

$$
\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}
$$

Where:

$O_i$ = Observed frequency

$E_i$ = Expected frequency

## Step 1: Load Your Data

Use the method that you developed to work with your data.

```{r load_data, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# We have used code like this
my_data <- read_csv("your_file.csv")
glimpse(my_data)
```

## Step 2: Summarize Your Categorical Variable

```{r freq_table, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Replace 'your_column' with the name of your categorical column
table(my_data$your_column)
```

We’ll use the `gapminder` dataset as an example throughout this
tutorial. First, we’ll prepare the data by creating a categorical
variable and summarizing it.

This code will create a new variable that will determine the median
population across all countries. Then, we will use this later to
determine if the balance among the continents is equal.

We are asking: “How many countries in this continent are above the
global median, and how many are below?” -OR- “Is there a relationship
between continent and being a high- or low-population country, relative
to the global midpoint?”

This gives us a **2 × 5 contingency table** (2 population categories × 5
continents), which is perfect for a **chi-squared test of
independence**.

```{r run_gapminder_prepare, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
gapminder_sample <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  mutate(pop_cat = ifelse(pop > median(pop), "High", "Low"))

table_data <- table(gapminder_sample$continent, gapminder_sample$pop_cat)
table_data
```

Our data is now represented in a table that has one categorical variable
in the rows (e.g., continent) and another categorical variable in the
columns (e.g., population category). Each cell represents the count of
how many cases fall into each combination. This table will be plugged
into the function to run our test.

## Step 3: Check Assumptions

Before we proceed, we must check that we are not violating any
assumptions for our test. Those assumptions are:

1.  Expected frequency in each cell should be ≥ 5
2.  Observations should be independent

```{r assumptions, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Use expected frequencies to check your data
chisq.test(table(my_data$your_column))$expected
```

We now check the assumptions of the chi-squared test: expected counts
should be ≥ 5, and observations should be independent.

```{r run_gapminder_assumptions, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
chisq_test_result <- chisq.test(table_data)
chisq_test_result$expected
any(chisq_test_result$expected < 5)
```

The result is `TRUE`, meaning that we have a cell that is less than 5.
We will drop this row from our table.

```{r run_gapminder_assumptions2, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
# Drop any rows that are less than 5 for example
gapminder_sample <- gapminder_sample %>%
  filter(continent != "Oceania")
```

*Technically, a side note*: Fisher’s Exact Test is a statistical test
used to examine the association between two categorical variables — just
like the chi-squared test — but specifically designed for small sample
sizes or when expected counts are very low (usually \< 5 in one or more
cells). In our case, to use the standard chi-squared test, we will drop
the row that is less than 5, but Fisher's Exact Test could be used
instead.

## Step 4: Run the Chi-Squared Goodness-of-Fit Test

```{r run_gof, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# For equal probabilities
chisq.test(table(my_data$your_column))
```

```{r run_custom_gof, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# With custom probabilities (e.g., 0.3, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2)
chisq.test(table(my_data$your_column), p = c(0.3, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2))
```

### **Our hypotheses**

-   **Null hypothesis (**H0H_0H0​): The two variables are
    **independent**.\
    Population category (High/Low) is **not associated** with continent.

-   **Alternative hypothesis (**HAH_AHA​): The variables are
    **dependent**.\
    There **is** an association between population category and
    continent.

We can now run the test and view the results.

```{r run_gapminder_test, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
# We saved this object in Step 3: Check Assumptions
# chisq_test_result <- chisq.test(table_data)
chisq_test_result
```

## Step 5: Visualize the Distribution

```{r plot_bar, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Observed visualization example
ggplot(my_data, aes(x = your_column)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Observed Frequencies", x = "Category", y = "Count")
```

Visualizations help us interpret the relationship between categorical
variables.

```{r gapminder_plot, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
ggplot(gapminder_sample, aes(x = continent, fill = pop_cat)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(
    title = "Population Category by Continent (Gapminder 2007)",
    x = "Continent",
    y = "Count",
    fill = "Population"
  )
```

Chi-squared tests don’t evaluate **one group** (like Asia) on its own.
They look at **all combinations** across the full table — so any single
difference has to be strong enough to influence the **overall pattern**.

One bar (Asia's "High" count) might look lower, but if other continents'
counts are close to expected, the overall difference might still be
**within the range of chance variation**.

That is, if the observed counts **aren’t *that far off*** from expected
ones, even visible differences may not add up to a big enough
chi-squared value to pass the significance threshold.

A fancier visualization:

```{r calculate-proportions, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
library(dplyr)

# Summarize data to get counts and proportions
bar_data <- gapminder_sample %>%
  group_by(continent, pop_cat) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  mutate(
    prop = n / sum(n),
    se = sqrt((prop * (1 - prop)) / sum(n)),  # standard error for a proportion
    lower = prop - 1.96 * se,  # 95% CI lower
    upper = prop + 1.96 * se   # 95% CI upper
  )

```

```{r viz-proportions, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
ggplot(bar_data, aes(x = continent, y = prop, fill = pop_cat)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge(width = 0.9)) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper),
    width = 0.2,
    position = position_dodge(width = 0.9)
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Proportion of Population Category by Continent (Gapminder 2007)",
    x = "Continent",
    y = "Proportion",
    fill = "Population"
  ) +
  ylim(0, 1)

```

## Step 6: Interpret the Results

```{r hidden-variables, include=FALSE}
# Chi-squared value
chisq_value <- chisq_test_result$statistic

# Degrees of freedom
df <- chisq_test_result$parameter

# p-value
p_val <- chisq_test_result$p.value
```

Now we interpret the test results:

-   Chi-squared value

-   Degrees of freedom

-   p-value

> If *p* \< .05, we reject the null hypothesis that the distribution is
> what we expected.

[**Example write-up:**]{.underline}

"A chi-square test of goodness-of-fit was conducted to determine whether
card suits were selected at random. The results were significant, χ²(3)
= 8.44, *p* = .038, suggesting that choices were not equally distributed
across suits."

```{r view_gapminder_test, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
chisq_test_result
```

The chi-squared test did not reveal a significant association between
continent and population category, $\chi^2$
(`r chisq_test_result$parameter`)=
`r round(chisq_test_result$statistic, 2)`, *p* =
`r round(chisq_test_result$p.value, 4)`.

## Analyze Your Own Data

Now it's your turn! Upload a CSV file, choose a categorical column,
check assumptions, run the test, and interpret your output.

```{r student_practice, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Replace the placeholder with your real column name
chisq.test(table(my_data$your_column))
```

## Optional: Chi-Squared Goodness-of-Fit

You have one categorical variable, and you want to test whether its
observed frequencies match some expected distribution. You don’t need a
2D table — just a vector of counts.

```{r test_of_independence_template, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Chi-Squared Goodness-of-Fit Test
# Use this when you have ONE categorical variable 
# and want to test expected proportions

# Get observed counts
observed <- table(my_data$var1)

# Define expected proportions (must add up to 1)
# Example: equal proportions across 3 categories
expected <- rep(1/length(observed), length(observed))

# Run the test
chisq.test(x = observed, p = expected)
```

Suppose you have observed continent counts in 2007 (from gapminder):

```{r gof-table, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
table(gapminder_sample$continent)
```

Let’s say you expect the continents to be equally represented (uniform
distribution). Then you'd do:

```{r gof-test, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
# equal proportions
observed <- table(gapminder_sample$continent) 
expected <- rep(1/length(observed), length(observed))

chisq.test(x = observed, p = expected) 
```

This tests: “Do the observed continent frequencies differ significantly
from what we'd expect if they were equally likely?”
