## *t*-Tests: Comparing Means

In this tutorial, we’ll walk through how to compare means using three
different types of ***t*****-tests**, depending on your data and
research design.

When we compare two sets of numbers (like test scores, weights, or
ratings), we use t-tests to help figure out whether the differences we
see are meaningful or just due to chance.

These tests are helpful in answering questions like:

-   Is the average score in a class significantly different from a
    passing score (like 70)?
-   Do students in two different classrooms score differently on the
    same test?
-   Does a group’s average performance improve after an intervention
    (like a training session)?

We will walk through three types of *t*-tests:

1.  One-sample t-test
2.  Independent-samples t-test
3.  Dependent-samples (paired) t-test

What do you need to use a t-test?

-   A **continuous** (numeric) outcome variable (like test score,
    height, or weight)

-   **Grouping variable** (only for independent/dependent t-tests)

-   Reasonable **sample size** (not too small)

-   **Normal** distribution (especially for small samples)

-   No significant **outliers**

### One- vs. Two-Tailed Tests

What's a one-tailed or two-tailed test?

-   A **two-tailed test** checks for any difference (higher or lower)
-   A **one-tailed test** checks for a difference in a specific
    direction (only higher *or* only lower)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## One-Sample *t*-Test

### When to Use This Test

Use the one-sample *t*-test when you want to compare the mean of your
sample to a known or hypothesized population value.

**Example:** Suppose we know the national average exam score is 75, and
we want to see if our class scores differently.

### **Assumptions**

-   You're testing **one group** against a **single value**.
-   Data are **continuous** (interval/ratio scale) and approximately
    **normally distributed**.
-   Observations are **independent**.

### **Template Code**

``` r
# default is two-tailed
t.test(data$variable, mu = 75) 

# one-tailed
t.test(data$variable, mu = 0, alternative = "greater")
t.test(data$variable, mu = 0, alternative = "less")
```

### Example

```{r}
# Efficency of cars
data(mtcars)
t.test(mtcars$mpg, mu = 30)
```

```{r warning=FALSE}
# Visualization
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, fill = "#69b3a2", alpha = 0.7, color = "white") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 20, linetype = "dashed", color = "red", size = 1.2) +
  labs(
    title = "Miles per Gallon (mpg)",
    x = "MPG",
    y = "Frequency"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

### **Interpretation**

-   Look at the ***t*****-value** and ***p*****-value**: Is the
    difference big enough to be considered unlikely by chance?
-   Use the **confidence interval** to estimate where the true mean
    likely falls.
-   "A one-sample *t*-test was conducted to determine whether the mean
    of [variable] differed significantly from [hypothesized value]. The
    results showed that the mean [was/was not] significantly different
    from [value], *t*(df) = t-value, *p* = p-value, *d* = effect size."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Independent-Samples t-Test**

### **When to Use This Test**

Use the **independent-samples t-test** when comparing the means of **two
[separate]{.underline} groups**.

**Example:** Which bug spray is more effective, Group 1 or Group 2?

### **Key Concepts**

-   Groups must be **independent** (different participants in each
    group).
-   Assumes that the data is **normally distributed** and that the two
    groups have **similar variances**.
-   If variances aren’t similar, use **Welch’s t-test** (the default in
    R).

### Template Code

``` r
t.test(score ~ group, data = my_data)
```

-   Use `var.equal = TRUE` if you’re assuming equal variances.
-   R will automatically do Welch’s t-test if variances differ.

### Example

```{r}
# Load data
data("InsectSprays")

insect_grouped <- InsectSprays %>%
  mutate(group = case_when(
    spray %in% c("A", "B", "F") ~ "Group1",
    spray %in% c("C", "D", "E") ~ "Group2"
  ))
```

```{r}
# Visualization
ggplot(insect_grouped, aes(x = group, y = count, fill = group)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "Insect Counts by Spray Group",
    x = "Spray Group",
    y = "Number of Insects"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# Possible outlier in Group 2
```

```{r}
# Check variance
var.test(count ~ group, data = insect_grouped)
# Significant => therefore, use Welsh's
```

```{r}
# Independent t-test
t.test(count ~ group, data = insect_grouped)
```

```{r}
# Effect size
cohen.d(count ~ group, data = insect_grouped)
```

### **Interpretation**

-   The **p-value** tells you if the group means differ significantly.
-   Report the **effect size** (**Cohen’s d**) to describe how big the
    difference is.
-   "An independent-samples *t*-test was conducted to compare [insect
    counts] between [spray groups]. There was a [significant/not
    significant] difference in insect counts between Group1 (*M* = X̄₁)
    and Group2 (*M* = X̄₂); *t*(df) = t-value, *p* = p-value."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Paired-Samples t-Test**

### **When to Use This Test**

Use the **paired-samples t-test** when comparing **two
[related]{.underline} measurements**—like before/after scores from the
same people.

**Example:** Did sleep improve using Drug 1 or Drug 2?

### **Key Concepts**

-   This test looks at the **difference between paired values** (e.g.,
    ScoreAfter - ScoreBefore).
-   You must have **matched or repeated measures**.
-   Assumes the **differences** between scores are normally distributed.

### **Template Code**

``` r
t.test(data$before, data$after, paired = TRUE)
```

### Example

```{r}
# Loading data
data(sleep)

# Data manipulation
sleep_wide <- sleep %>%
  pivot_wider(
    id_cols = ID,
    names_from = group,
    values_from = extra,
    names_prefix = "drug"
  )

print(sleep_wide)
```

```{r}
# Relabel group variable
sleep_labeled <- sleep %>%
  mutate(group = factor(group, 
                        levels = c(1, 2), 
                        labels = c("Drug 1", "Drug 2")))

# Visualization
ggplot(sleep_labeled, aes(x = extra, fill = group)) +
  geom_histogram(position = "identity", bins = 10, alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(
    title = "Histogram of Extra Sleep by Drug Group",
    x = "Extra Sleep (hours)",
    y = "Count",
    fill = "Drug"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#1f77b4", "#ff7f0e")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
# Paired samples t-test
t.test(sleep_wide$drug1, sleep_wide$drug2, paired = TRUE)
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Effect size
cohen.d(sleep$extra ~ sleep$group, paired = TRUE)
```

This tells you how large the change was, in terms of standard deviations
of the difference scores.

### **Interpretation**

-   A **significant p-value** means the average change was unlikely to
    be due to chance.
-   "A paired-samples *t*-test was conducted to compare [DV] under
    [Condition 1] and [Condition 2]. There was a
    [significant/non-significant] difference in scores between the two
    conditions; *t*(df) = t-value, *p* = p-value, *d* = effect size."

## Putting It All Together

| Test | Use When... | R Code |
|----|----|----|
| One-sample t-test | Comparing a sample to a **known value** | `t.test(x, mu = value)` |
| Independent-samples t-test | Comparing two **different** groups | `t.test(score ~ group)` |
| Paired-samples t-test | Comparing **repeated** or **matched** measures | `t.test(before, after, paired = TRUE)` |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Tips for All t-tests

-   **Visualize your data** first (boxplots, histograms, etc.).
-   **Check assumptions** (especially normality and equal variances).
-   **Report both significance and effect size**.
-   **Use confidence intervals** to describe uncertainty.
